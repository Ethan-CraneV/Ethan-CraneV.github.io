                    After I was introduced to 3D printing in the first year of university by using the facilities offered by my university, I decided to purchase a printer of my own. I went for an Anet A8 model,
                    which was the cheapest do-it-yourself kit available at the time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Anet A8 is a surprisingly precise performer, and I was more than impressed by the print quality I was achieving out of the box. I know this contrasts with most user reviews of this model,
                    so I must have gotten lucky. I've also been lucky to suffer no thermal failures, which were known to plague this model during the early days.
                    The printer was upgraded with self-printed parts and given a glass bed to counteract the deformation of the heated aluminum bed.
                    The Anet A8 is not a perfect machine. It is made with cheap parts and it requires a significant amount of maintenance.
                    Many parts have been repeatedly replaced due to failure or fatigue. The cheap acrylic frame is susceptible to vibrations, degrading print quality. The extruder is 
                    decent but has problems with clogging and unde-extrusion occasionally. The barebones mainboard was extremely limited and the LCD has suffered from visual degradation over time.

                    I'm not a fan of breathing the printer-air while the machine is in use. Though there are no known VOC emission generated from PLA printing, I still don't quite trust that it's wholly
                    safe to breath in the emissions of the melted plastic. Additionally, I sometimes print in ABS, which is known to generate harmful emissions. Thus I always print with an enclosure around the printer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm also not a fan of manual bed levelling, though I don't believe anyone really is. I believe a bed-levelling probe is an absolute requirement. It's good to see auto-bed levelling being
                    implemented by manufacturers in most modern 3D printer models. My first bed leveller consisted of conductive pads that were tied to a pin on the mainboard. A potential was applied to the hotend
                    and it was used as a probe to complete the circuit, thus detecting the bed. This would run into issues when the nozzle would get dirty or ooze during preheating before prints. Interestingly this is starting
                    to become a trend again as we see some of the larger printer manufacturers implementing this "direct probe" approach in their models. These new printers often include a self-cleaing nozzle.

                    <br>
                    I consider a print server a must-have component in modern printers as well. 2D printers have had this for well over a decade now, though understandably 3D print servers have increased processing
                    requirements for handling things like remote print monitoring or 3D viewer rendering. My 3D printer lacks an integrated print server, so all network communication is handled by an external raspberry pi
                    and OctoPrint, which is the standard arrangement for 3D printers without servers.
                    <br>

                    My slicer of choice is Cura. This can be a divisive topic, depending on who you ask. As an aside, I have tried PrusaSlicer and Bambu Studio and I must say I'm actually quite a fan of both, but for feature support
                    and just for familiarity's sake I have always used Cura, though I am not opposed to switching in the future should one slicer prove to be more feature rich while remaing stable and in active development.
