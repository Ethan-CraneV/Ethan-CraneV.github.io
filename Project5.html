                    McMaster used to host yearly "sumobot" competitions for students. The goal of this competition was to create an autonomous robot that was capable of pushing
                    an opponent's robot out of a ring to score. The competition imposed a set of constraints on the
                    combatants, such as requiring the robots to be no larger than 10cm x 10cm in length and width (height was unrestricted), and weigh no more than 500g. My responsibilities in our
                    team included the hardware design and construction.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A CAD model of the chassis was first created, which was then 3D printed. The entirety of the chassis was 3D printed. The robot was designed in two pieces. A lower chassis housed
                    the drive motors and battery, while the upper portion housed the microcontroller.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The other team members developed the robot's behavioural routine. Using IR sensors on the bottom of the chassis, it would detect the edge of the white-painted ring and move to get away from
                    it. Using an ultrasonic sensor on the front of the chassis, the robot would be able to locate the opponent and charge toward it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For the drive train, we went with a more unorthodox method of using servo motors to drive treaded tracks. Our decision to use servos instead of high-speed DC motors came from
                    the idea that servo motors have internal gearboxes, giving them very high output torque. We hoped to use this torque to push our opponents from the ring. As it turned out, most
                    servos aren't designed to allow multiple revolutions, so we had to modify them and remove their internal potentiometers to allow them to rotate freely. Looking back, we probably could have
                    sourced geared DC motors instead, but we didn't think of this at the time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Midterms arrived just before the competition that year. This created time-management issues as we struggled to prioritize studying vs robot development.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Many issues made themselves known during testing. Though we didn't know it at the time, the power draw of the servo-driven drive train was above the maximum output capabilities
                    of the arduino microcontroller. (We tried to drive the servos directly from the arduino, please forgive us, we were young and stupid)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On top of the power problem, we soon discovered our IR sensors didn't work either. We were missing a crucial driver board required that processed the raw analog values from the IR 
                    emitter and receiver diodes into digestible digital data for the Arduino. (Again, we sort of just dove into this without much preparation or research, looking back you think it's so
                    obvious, but at the time we were oblivious)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With our environmental awareness gutted from the loss of the IR sensors, we decided to go primal. We made a simple routine in which our robot would simply spin around on the spot
                    until its ultrasonic sensor picked up a target. Once found, our robot would charge forward blindly at its opponent, stopping only if it lost line-of-sight, and resuming its
                    search. This purely predatory program was surprisingly effective, and actually resulted in a few victorious rounds during the competition.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A critical failure came from my mistake with making the treaded drivetrain. Every component of the robot was 3D printed, including the tracks that the robot moved about on.
                    Smooth plastic doesn't have much traction, and even after my efforts to add some hot-glue pads to each tread, the robot was still very slippery. After overcoming our previous perils,
                    it was ultimately this slipperiness that killed our chances at the competition. There were a few moments when the treads would dig in just right, and our robot would plow ahead and
                    defeat the opponent, but for the most part our robot was killed off every round as its super-servo-torque was wasted while it glided out of the ring.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Regardless of the outcome, this was one of the most fun projects I've worked on. I gained a huge amount of insight in project scope management and time allocation, and me and my friends
                    had a great time watching our little creation try it's best at the competition.
