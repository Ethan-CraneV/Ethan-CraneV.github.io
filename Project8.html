                    This "hand prosthetic" as it was called was an assignment given as part of the McMaster Engineering 1 Cornerstone Design Project. The project gave a set of design 
                    specifications which included the following:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1. A specific gear ratio of 12:1 from the input gear to the output gears.<br>
                    2. The output (finger and thumb) axles were constrained to a specific spatial distance away from the input axle, as defined by the prefabricated prosthetic frame.<br>
                    3. The tips of the finger and thumb had to meet when closed.<br>
                    4. The assembly had to fit within a prefabricated prosthetic frame which was provided.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The gear ratio is 2:1 * 2:1 * 3:1 * 1:1 * 1:1
                    The axles and hex nuts were provided. The frame was assembled using hot glue and super glue, and post-print modifications were made by melting the material with a soldering iron to get the gears to mesh correctly. 
                    These modifications were needed due to the precision errors that arose during the 3D printing process.
