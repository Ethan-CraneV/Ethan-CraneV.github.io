                    A network fileserver made from recycled parts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The power supply, motherboard, CPU, and case were all salvaged from machines that were being thrown away. The hard drives are mostly leftovers from my own computers, swapped out
                    over time for ones with larger storage capacities. The machine fits into a mini-ITX form factor, and the motherboard is micro-ATX. The power supply came from the salvaged mini-ITX case and
                    had to be moved to the front to fit the micro-ATX board, and an internal extension cable had to be made to move the power connector port back to the rear of the case.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The system features an Intel i3-2120, 8GB DDR3 RAM (non-ECC), and a total storage capacity of 6TB. The server runs FreeNas, a free NAS-oriented operating system based on FreeBSD, 
                    with the storage pool running RAID-Z2 (aka RAID 6), allowing for 2 disk failures before data loss. This yields a total available storage volume of about 4TB. 5 of the disks
                    are full 3.5" drives, with one being a 2.5", and some creative mounting had to be used to fit all of the components into the tiny case.

                    <br>
                    The NAS is plugged into a 350W UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply), providing battery backup when the power goes out. This means that if wall power cuts out there is no risk of
                    data corruption during a write and no risk of data loss from sudden spin-down. The UPS ended up being a critical component since the house I live in currently is susceptible to
                    rolling brownouts, which wreak havoc on a NAS that's not designed to spin-down often.

                Not the best for vibration management but it was all I could do given what little space there was in the case:</p>
