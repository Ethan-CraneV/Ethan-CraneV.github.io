                    This was built for a final project assignment in grade 12. It was a simple 8x8 LED display. Each LED corresponds to a grid point and is illuminated by
                    setting it's corresponding row to +5V, and grounding its respective column. This allowed all 64 LEDs to be controlled by 16 pins. The display was driven by an Arduino Uno.

                    This is a pretty basic device, but I thought I'd throw it in here since it was a valuable learning experience at the time. Given what I've learned since that point, if I were
                    to attempt making it again I would probably employ a multiplexer circuit to reduce the number of driving pins required. This device also
                    came with the limitation that certain patterns could not be displayed, as the lines would often become busy if attempting to illuminate multiple LEDs, leading to additional
                    unwanted LEDs powering on when their circuits were completed.
