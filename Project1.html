                    A directed ranged microwave emitter, for microwaving things at-a-distance. Built using conventional consumer microwave ovens.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Magnetron: The magnetron is the device that creates electromagnetic radiation within the microwave wavelength range. It does this via some very complex
                    physics that I can only somewhat comprehend. The un-scientific gist of it is that a component is heated within a specially shaped cavity, and as electrons
                    are released they are whizzed around by the attraction between the component and the surrounding cavity due to their opposite charges. The cavity is very specifically shaped in 
                    such a way that the magnetic field present within it guides the electrons in arcing paths until they fling around and out the magnetron. During this process the magnetron can get
                    pretty hot, so some form of thermal management is required as well. This was handled via a 12VDC computer fan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Power Circuit: The power circuit for the magnetron consists of a step-up transformer and high voltage AC capacitor. The step-up transformer increases the mains 120VAC from the wall
                    up to ~2000VAC. A capacitor and diode are arranged to form a voltage doubler at the output, bringing the total voltage to 4000VAC to drive the magnetron. As you can
                    imagine, I wasn't all that excited by the idea of holding an object at 4000V potential in my hands, fearing it might choose me as it's path to ground. The device lacked
                    a portable power source of it's own, and I was certain to ensure everything was grounded through the tether connection to mains power. A lightswitch acted as the main toggle, a lightbulb
                    served as an "armed" indicator, and a pushbutton trigger located near the carry handle allowed the user to energize the magnetron and "fire" the device.

                    <br>
                    Waveguide: The barrel of this device was created from a piece of metal ducting. I later learned that the wide circular shape of the barrel was highly ineffective. Replacing the waveguide would
                    be essential in future revisions of the device.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    SAFETY: Necessary precautions were taken when developing and testing the device. Electrical isolation of the user was paramount during operation of the device.
                    Microwave radiation within this range of the spectrum is non-ionizing, meaning it cannot damage DNA or cause cancer, it can however cook you pretty quickly, especially with regard to the eyes.
                    Although crude, the door of the microwave oven was refashioned into a face shield to allow the device to be viewed during firing. Finally, magnetrons are sometimes manufactured with 
                    beryllium-oxide insulative caps that if cracked can release an extremely hazardous dust into the air. Inhaling this dust can induce lifelong chronic berylliosis, a debilitating lung
                    condition. I made certain to handle the magnetrons with care.

                    Version 1 of the Microwave Emitter turned out semi-successful. Its only drawback was its limited range. The device was only capable of exciting something within 30cm of its
                    barrel, meaning that it didn't quite microwave things "at a distance" like originally intended.

                    Version 2 was halted during the testing phase due to school-related obligations. Perhaps the project could be revisited in the future.
