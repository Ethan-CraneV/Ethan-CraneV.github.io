                    The goal of this project was to create a wieldable directed microwave emitter to cook or heat something at a distance using the same technology found
                    in a common household microwave oven. Two versions were made, each of which built by gutting a household microwave oven and rearranging
                    the magnetron and its power circuit.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Magnetron: The magnetron is the device that creates electromagnetic radiation within the microwave wavelength range. It does this via some very very complex
                    physics that frankly I can only somewhat comprehend. The un-scientific gist of it is that a component is heated within a specially shaped cavity, and as electrons
                    are released they are whizzed around by the attraction between the component and the surrounding cavity due to their opposite charges. The cavity is very specifically shaped in 
                    such a way that the magnetic field present within it guides the electrons in arcing paths until they fling around and out the magnetron. During this process the magnetron can get
                    pretty hot, so some form of thermal management is required as well. To solve this in my case I took a couple 5V AC-DC power converters and wired them in series to drive a 12V computer fan.
                    For the most part it worked, but a couple of my fans burned out due to the intense magnetic field around the magnetron, and so they had to be replaced.

                    <br>
                    Power Circuit: The power circuit for the magnetron consists of a step-up transformer and high voltage AC capacitor. The step-up transformer increases the mains 120VAC from the wall
                    up to ~2000VAC. A capacitor and diode are arranged to form a voltage doubler at the output, bringing the total voltage to the 4000VAC required to drive the magnetron. As you can
                    imagine, I wasn't all that excited by the idea of holding an object at 4000V potential in my hands, fearing it might choose me as it's path to ground. Since the device didn't
                    have a portable power source of it's own, I was certain to ensure everything was grounded through the connection to mains power. The entire device was powered on via a light switch
                    installed in the rear, and a lightbulb served as an indicator light for when the device was armed. A pushbutton switch located on the upper carrying handle acted as the trigger,
                    completing the input circuit to the step-up transformer and energizing the magnetron.

                    Waveguide: The barrel of this device was created from a piece of metal ducting. After some basic research into the subject of waveguides I later learned that the wide circular
                    shape of the barrel is actually one of the worst shapes I could have used. Something about how the waves propagate causes them to lose power. In version 2 of the Microwave Emitter, I
                    formed a new waveguide by coating cardboard with layers of aluminum foil. I read somewhere that the most effective waveguide shape was one with a rectangular cross section in which
                    the length is twice the width. I'm not super knowledgeable in wave behaviour so most of my hope lied in finding experimental results.

                    <br>
                    SAFETY: I researched the possible hazards associated with tinkering in microwaves and took the necessary precautions when working on version 1 and 2 of the device. First and most
                    important is the obvious factor of 4000VAC coursing through the machine. I was very paranoid of becoming a grounding rod, so I ensured I always had insulating gloves and electrically
                    rated boots on before powering on the device. The other obvious danger lied in me accidentally cooking myself. Microwave radiation within this range of the spectrum is
                    non-ionizing, meaning it cannot damage DNA or cause cancer, it can however cook you pretty well, especially in regards to the eyes, so I repurposed
                    the door of the microwave oven to act as a face shield. It featured a metal grid with holes small enough to allow light to pass through, while blocking the longer wavelengths of the
                    microwave radiation, allowing me to view the device in safety. A less obvious but more deadly threat to take care of lied in the magnetron itself. Magnetrons are sometimes manufactured with 
                    beryllium-oxide insulative caps that if cracked can release an extremely hazardous dust into the air. Inhaling this dust can induce lifelong chronic berylliosis, a debilitating lung
                    condition. I made certain to handle the magnetrons with care.

                    Version 1 of the Microwave Emitter turned out rather successful. Its only drawback was its extremely limited range. The device was only capable of exciting something within a foot of its
                    barrel, meaning that it didn't exactly microwave things "at a distance" like I originally hoped for.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Version 2 of the device sadly never made it past the testing phase. It was during the development of version 2 that I learned that most household microwave ovens come equipped
                    with a magnetron that is only capable of outputting a limited amount of energy to comply with safety regulations. The energy released decays almost entirely after 
                    travelling approximately 12 inches through atmosphere. So my goal of obtaining a range above a foot would not be possible. It was then and there that I decided to close this
                    project for good.
