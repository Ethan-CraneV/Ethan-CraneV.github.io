        <h1>Presenting: My Personal Portfolio of Projects and Ponderings</h1>
        <p>This is the home of my (Ethan Crane-Vaillancourt) portfolio. 
            I've included projects here from back in high school up until now, and I'll keep adding more on to the list as I go.
            Please bear in mind that this site itself is a project, and if it looks like trash that's because I'm still very new to CSS. Continuous 
            improvements will be applied over time.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm not a fan of writing "About Myself" pages, so I'll just list some personal interests of mine here:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Robotics: Electromechanical systems, automated manufacturing, human-wearable powered exoskeletons in particular are one of my biggest interests.</li>
            <li>Nuclear Energy: Big supporter. I believe it's essential as a solid, consistent base to build a future green energy grid upon.</li>
            <li>"Green Energy": All things renewable have dazzled me since grade school. My biggest interests are in bringing renewables to the consumer's home. (See: Solar Project)</li>
            <li>Video Games: My favourite pass-time, Halo is easily my top favourite series of all time.</li>
            <li>Jiu-Jitsu: Although I don't practice it anymore. I am a huge fan of the non-striking arts.</li>
            <li>3D-Printing: After getting a taste for printing during my first year of university, I purchased a printer for myself. Being able to rapidly fabricate a 3-dimensional object 
                is simply amazing. I'm always looking for ways to improve the technology of my printer at home.</li>
            <li>Computer Hardware: I'm always trying to keep up with the latest hardware developments. I currently have a long-term goal to shrink my desktop PC every
                time I upgrade it. Eventually I hope to reach the smallest form factor possible without compromising its hardware capabilities. It's more of a fun side pursuit
                that has lasted for about 5 years now. I'm currently sitting at a case volume of 11L. Not sure if it'll be economically possible to go lower.
            </li>
        </ul>
