                    Much akin to the Ship of Theseus, almost none of its original components remain, yet I feel that it always remains the same. 
                </p>
                <h4>HARDWARE:</h4>
                <p>
                    The computer started off as a prebuilt, I wasn't very knowledgeable nor confident in my ability to build a custom PC, so I bought a rather overpriced Alienware machine back in
                    the beginning. It started off with the following specs:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CPU: Intel i7 3770</li>
                    <li>GPU: Nvidia GTX 660</li>
                    <li>RAM: 16GB DDR3 1600MHz</li>
                    <li>PSU: Proprietary PSU (Unknown wattage)</li>
                    <li>MB: Proprietary Mini-ITX</li>
                    <li>Storage: 1TB HDD</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The power supply and GPU were the first components to be replaced.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now I had a new PSU and GPU, but I had another problem. The pre-built case was way too tiny to fit anything new in there, a portion of the case was removed to make room for 
                    the new GPU to fit. The PSU simply couldn't fit inside the case, it was fixed to the outside of the case with industrial velcro. A hole was cut through the side of the case to 
                    route the cables. There is a picture of that mess down below.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The CPU cooler was later upgrade to a water cooling loop. I opted for a Corsair closed-loop AIO cooler which is still in use today.
                    It too couldn't fit in the case, so it was bolted to the power supply already velcroed to the outside. The machine was starting to look like an abomination.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eventually a proper mid-tower case was purchased to properly house everything.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Current Specs:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li>
                    <li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT</li>
                    <li>RAM: 16GB DDR4 3200MHz</li>
                    <li>PSU: Corsair 750W</li>
                    <li>MB:  Mini-ITX</li>
                    <li>Storage: 750GB SSD, 1TB HDD</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4>SOFTWARE:</h4>
                <p>
                    The system is a dual-boot installation of Arch Linux and Windows, using rEFInd as my boot manager. REFInd was chosen as an exercise since I was already familiar with GRUB. rEFInd has proven to be
                    very resilient and it was easy to install and configure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Both operating systems share a 3TB drive which stores all personal documents and files. Getting both operating systems to play nice was
                    a bit tricky at first. Windows does not support the ext4 filesystem that Linux primarily uses, and Linux does not come with native support for the NTFS filesystem type that Windows
                    prefers. The ntfs-3g package for linux offers compatibilty with NTFS drives, so with an edit of the FSTAB file the Linux system can mount the HDD as an NTFS on boot, and the system
                    is then capable of read/write. Both OSs now work in harmony and my files can be accessed on each OS in the same location, making switching between the two seamless. So far I haven't run
                    into any nasty permission issues between the two and fingers crossed things stay that way.
